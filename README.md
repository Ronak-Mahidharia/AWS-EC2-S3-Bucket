ETL Data Pipeline using Apache Airflow and AWS

Overview:
This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The pipeline automates the process of fetching data, transforming it, and storing it securely in an AWS S3 bucket.

Technologies Used:
•	Apache Airflow: Orchestrates and schedules tasks in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
•	AWS EC2: Hosts the Airflow server to run workflows.
•	AWS S3: Stores both raw and transformed data.
•	Python: Handles data extraction and transformation processes.
•	Boto3: Python library for interacting with AWS services.

Pipeline Workflow:
1.	Extract: The pipeline extracts raw data from an external source (such as a public API or dataset).
2.	Transform: Python scripts clean and convert the data into a desired format (e.g., filtering out invalid entries or reshaping the structure).
3.	Load: The transformed data is uploaded to S3 for further storage and analysis.

Setup & Configuration:
1.	Launch EC2 Instance: Set up a Linux-based EC2 instance and install Apache Airflow.
2.	Configure Airflow DAGs: Define your tasks in a DAG file to control task dependencies and execution order.
3.	Integrate with AWS S3: Use Boto3 to upload data from the EC2 instance to S3.
4.	Automate Task Scheduling: Airflow’s scheduler triggers the DAG at specified intervals or based on conditions.
5.	Monitoring: Use the Airflow UI to monitor pipeline performance and task completion.

Usage Example:
•	Use Case: Fetch weather data from an API, clean and structure it into a CSV, and store it in a dedicated S3 bucket.
•	Scheduling: Set the pipeline to run daily to ensure up-to-date information is available in the S3 storage.

Challenges & Solutions:
•	Data Quality Checks: Implemented checks to ensure no missing or corrupted data is stored in S3.
•	Error Handling: Added Airflow retries to handle temporary connection issues or API failures.
•	Scalability: The Airflow setup on EC2 allows scaling the pipeline by adding more DAGs or workers as needed.

Future Improvements:
•	Integrate the pipeline with AWS Lambda for real-time data processing.
•	Add visualization dashboards using Power BI or Tableau for real-time insights.
